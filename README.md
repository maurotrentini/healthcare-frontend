# Healthcare Admin Dashboard

This is a simple frontend application for managing appointments, doctors, clinics, and patients in a healthcare system. The app is built using **React**, powered by **Vite**, and styled with **Material UI (MUI)**. It interacts with a RESTful backend API (following the Hydra spec) to perform CRUD operations.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **React** (with Hooks)
- **Vite** (for fast development & hot reload)
- **Material UI (MUI)** (for UI components and styling)
- **React Router v6** (for client-side routing)
- **React Hook Form** (for form handling)
- **Axios** (via a simple API wrapper)
- **Hydra-powered API** (HATEOAS-compliant backend, such as API Platform)

## 📁 Project Structure

/src
/api ← Axios config and helpers
/components ← Reusable components like EntityList and Layout
/pages ← Appointments, Doctors, Clinics, Patients (List + Form)
